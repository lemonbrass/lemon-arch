## Introduction
A Bitstream based minimal and clean CPU for making cross platform native-speed apps.

## Philosophy
The main idea behind lemon-arch is that platform shouldn't restrict you from programming, the main bottleneck should be skills instead of platform-dependent stuff.

## State

Currently, the CPU Instruction set is in development, the instruction set pdf will be pushed when it is completed

The programming for this project has not initiated as currently, I am working in its design.
